# Eta_Meson_Analysis
ROOT-based C++ workflows (plus PYTHIA 8 event generation) for studying Œ∑-meson production and measuring its cross-section at mid-rapidity.

# Eta_Pion_Production/
Includes ROOT analysis scripts and PYTHIA8 (Monte Carlo Event Generator for high-energy physics collision) based in C++ for investigating Œ∑-meson and ùúã0 particle production and their initial state partons and immediate parents particle distributions.

# Eta_Meson_Cross_Section_Measurement/
Includes ROOT analysis scripts based in C++ that computes Œ∑-meson's yield, trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, and systematics, for measuring its cross-section cross-section at mid-rapidity.
